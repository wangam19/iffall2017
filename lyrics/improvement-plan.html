<p>
	<div>In my peer revisions, add some more dynamic elements to my lyrics page. My peers suggested I add a background to <br/> my lyric text to increase readability. I was also asked to incorporate more of my artist's flamboyant personality to the image. <br/>I decided to add a scaled up version of the song name and her name to the side to create an overall more dynamic page,<br/> I'm also adding styling and scale shifts to the body text.</div>
