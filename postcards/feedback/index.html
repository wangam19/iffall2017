		<h1>Feedback for Tommy</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Aesthetic</li>
				<ul>
				<li>consider the color palette of the tryptic (you currently have two pastel colors and a vibrant color)</li>
				<li>maybe choose a darker text color when the value of your background is light</li>
				<li>interesting choice of type, I think it works with the content</li>
				</ul>
				

			<li>Structure</li>
				<ul>
				<li>consider centering image and text elements more</li>
				<li>either think about using a more engaging background or look more carefully at how the image fills the space to create a more engaging composition</li>
				<li>if you want to use a more engaging patterned background, make sure you toggle with opacity or another element to maintain the text readability</li>
				</ul>


			<li>Technical Challenges</li>
				<ul>
				<li>improve the image quality of the Spongebob and Squidward images</li>
				<li>consider composition at a smaller size, the image currently runs off the background</li>
				<li>since the  project is already built that shouldn't be  a problem</li>
				</ul>

		</ul>
